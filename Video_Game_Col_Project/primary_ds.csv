In their immeasurable greed and constant thirst for power, the thirteen most powerful Mages of all time doomed the land, hurling it into an endless spiral of chaos and despair. Entire countries were wiped out in the blink of an eye when the devastating power of the Elements was unleashed – Elements summoned by dark rituals. Continents shattered like glass, the pieces strewn about like leaves in the wind. Huge armies, bound by the the power of ancient runes, brought war and destruction to the lands that survived the initial onslaught. All that was left were a few islands, connected by magic portals. 

Now, only a few years after the end of the Convocation, evil is back – stronger and more powerful than ever before – to finish what was started. 

Yet there is still hope. The prophecies tell of a human. A human damned to immortality, bound forever by the power of the blood runes… 

Soon, the time will come when the power of one may change the destiny of many. For better or for worse...

A version of Fate/stay night rated for ages 15 and up titled Fate/stay night Réalta Nua was released later.

Often, players will come to a ""decision point"" where they are given the chance to choose from options displayed on the screen, typically two to three at a time. There are three main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story.

World War II rages across Europe. Where once the Allies pressed advantage, the Nazi forces have turned the tide in dramatic fashion behind the technologically advanced war machine of General Wilhelm Strasse -- Deathshead. When a final Allied assault on Deathshead's compound fails, the Allies’ greatest hope falls with it. 
 
Europe, 1960. The war is over. And the Nazis are triumphant victors. Using unrelenting force and brutal intimidation, the Nazis have brought even the most powerful nations to their knees. The Nazi regime now rules the globe with an iron fist. 
 
You are Captain B.J. Blazkowicz, the American War Hero. After emerging into this world of darkness, you must launch an impossible counter-offensive against the monstrous Nazi regime. Only you dare stand up against an unstoppable army of Nazi robots and hulking Super Soldiers. Only you can stop Deathshead. Only you can rewrite history.","Wolfenstein: The New Order will be single-player-only. The game follows a standard first-person shooter formula with the player taking on enemies over the course of a level. The New Order utilizes a health system in which the player's health is divided into separate sections that regenerate; if an entire section is lost, the player must use a health pack to replenish the missing health, in a similar fashion to games such as The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay and Resistance: Fall of Man. The player also has access to a non-limited weapon inventory, dual wielding certain weapons, as well as the ability to lean around, over and under cover, and perform a combat slide. Certain weapons also have special abilities such as a laser cannon which transforms into a cutting tool, and some turrets can be pulled from their stationary position and carried around.

The gameplay by default is first person, but players have the option to play in third person mode. The core gameplay revolves around breaking and placing blocks. The game world is essentially composed of rough 3D objects—mainly cubes—that are arranged in a fixed grid pattern and represent different materials, such as dirt, stone, various ores, water, and tree trunks. While players can move freely across the world, objects and items can only be placed at fixed locations relative to the grid. Players can gather these material blocks and place them elsewhere, thus allowing for various constructions.","[17, 21, 33, 38, 268435469, 268435471, 268435487, 268435488, 268435489, 536870917, 536870983, 536871010, 536871029, 536871033, 536871065, 536871139, 536871208, 536871213, 536871244, 536871251, 536871289, 536871304, 536871421, 536871422, 536871443, 536871458, 536871470, 536871489, 536871506, 536871507, 536871529, 536871535, 536871570, 536871682, 536871889, 536871942, 536871945, 536872010, 536872015, 536872073, 536872205, 536872245, 536872257, 536872307, 536872371, 536872504, 536872557, 536872558, 536872622, 536872628, 536872647, 536872862, 536872928, 536873024, 536873030, 536873089, 536873092, 536873236, 536873249, 536873326, 536873364, 536873440, 536873454, 536873833, 536874022, 536874115, 536874373, 536874542, 536874706, 536874743, 536874834, 536875042, 536875046, 536875052, 536875066, 536875073, 536875090, 536875096, 536875106, 536875109, 536875122, 536875134, 536875147, 536875159, 536875173, 536875185, 536875214, 536875229, 536875232, 536875233, 536875241, 536875242, 536875244, 536875253, 536875259, 536875267, 536875269, 536875271, 536875275, 536875276, 536875304, 536875305, 536875313, 536875320, 536875330, 536875331, 536875340, 536875343, 536875344, 536875372, 536875377, 536875388, 536875427, 536875453, 536875461, 536875464, 536875488, 536875491, 536875492, 536875494, 536875502, 536875503, 536875517, 536875521, 536875541, 536875606, 536875607, 536875629, 536875640, 536875650, 536875665, 536875668, 536875675, 536875693, 536875699, 536875712, 536875735, 536875737, 536875741, 536875753, 536875758, 536875760, 536875778, 536875781, 536875791, 536875795, 536875802, 536875804, 536875809, 536875830, 536875832, 536875837, 536875872, 536875939, 536875941, 536876010, 536876033, 536876063, 536876068, 536876121, 536876126, 536876128, 536876171, 536876220, 536876228, 536876229, 536876240, 536876260, 536876263, 536876264, 536876274, 536876282, 536876287, 536876299, 536876304, 536876318, 536876334, 536876339, 536876374, 536876414, 536876416, 536876417, 536876424, 536876435, 536876444, 536876466, 536876473, 536876497, 536876525, 536876528, 536876571, 536876572, 536876580, 536876587, 536876621, 536876632, 536876678, 536876718, 536876762, 536876769, 536876877, 536876880, 536876884, 536876948, 536877040, 536877101, 536877124, 536877211, 536877305, 536877352, 536877368, 536877387, 536877407, 536877423, 536877565, 536877570, 536877583, 536877716, 536877738, 536877749, 536877761, 536877816, 536877864, 536877882, 536877910, 536877915, 536877955, 536878232, 536878239, 536878294, 536878314, 536878315, 536878322, 536878388, 536878511, 536878512, 536878523, 536878574, 536879112, 536879113, 536879781, 536879842, 536879950, 536879957, 536879999, 536880292, 536880444, 536880459, 536880461, 536880471, 536880524, 536880592, 536880863, 536880905, 536880960, 536882054, 536882392, 536882427, 536882694, 536882817, 536882890, 536882973, 536883166, 536883234, 536883271, 536883300, 536883371, 536883675, 536883709, 536883710, 536883711, 536883712, 536883713, 536883714, 536883715, 536883716, 536883717, 536883718, 536887739, 536887741, 536887742, 536887743, 536887744, 536887745, 536887746, 536887747, 536887749, 536887750, 536887752, 536888127, 536889519, 536890607, 536890703]","[17, 21, 33, 38]",121.0,83.5651459512052,716.0,https://www.igdb.com/games/minecraft

The main characters in this story are students at the “Keifu Academy”, a technical school, also known as a “specialized vocational high school”.

The protagonist of the game, Aoi Minase, is a young boy who lost his dream in a bicycle racing accident and subsequently returns to his hometown. There, he meets Kotori Habane, a young girl stuck with a wheelchair with a flat tire, on a hill with windmills.

They then spot large, white wings traversing the sky over the hills- a glider. Both had yet to realize that everything would begin from this.

Working together with Aoi’s childhood friend Ageha Himegi, they begin rebuilding the Soaring Club, which was just about to be disbanded.

In order to realise the dream everyone has as a child- “I want to soar up to the great sky and fly”, these beginners take hold of their passion, overcoming failures and obstacles from the school to put their all into building a glider.

They strive to fly through the “morning glory”, a special weather phenomenon that enables a special type of roll-shaped cloud that appears in the morning when the conditions are just right.","This game is an animated visual novel based on a youthful, dream filled high school life story.

The development team aims to push for true simulation,both in the sense of the physics system but also in allowing the player to open any door or drawer they'd logically be able to and examine what's inside, down to small details.","[31, 43, 268435458, 268435487, 268435488, 536870984, 536871006, 536871029, 536871447, 536871874, 536871878, 536871939, 536872010, 536872070, 536872222, 536872405, 536872406, 536872533, 536872609, 536872638, 536872647, 536872712, 536872715, 536872810, 536872843, 536872964, 536873273, 536873362, 536873454, 536873973, 536874115, 536874452, 536874813, 536875046, 536875050, 536875057, 536875060, 536875096, 536875098, 536875107, 536875110, 536875112, 536875113, 536875114, 536875116, 536875182, 536875199, 536875207, 536875208, 536875215, 536875216, 536875219, 536875231, 536875236, 536875242, 536875244, 536875260, 536875271, 536875275, 536875286, 536875287, 536875304, 536875315, 536875322, 536875328, 536875330, 536875335, 536875340, 536875342, 536875362, 536875364, 536875420, 536875488, 536875490, 536875492, 536875494, 536875501, 536875502, 536875503, 536875504, 536875505, 536875506, 536875507, 536875508, 536875510, 536875511, 536875512, 536875513, 536875524, 536875529, 536875531, 536875534, 536875537, 536875540, 536875541, 536875545, 536875546, 536875553, 536875638, 536875639, 536875737, 536875741, 536875745, 536875747, 536875750, 536875808, 536875831, 536875893, 536875900, 536875903, 536875937, 536875951, 536876014, 536876073, 536876075, 536876097, 536876098, 536876109, 536876126, 536876129, 536876130, 536876168, 536876173, 536876178, 536876179, 536876180, 536876183, 536876184, 536876185, 536876187, 536876188, 536876191, 536876196, 536876199, 536876287, 536876294, 536876320, 536876332, 536876338, 536876340, 536876425, 536876454, 536876462, 536876466, 536876474, 536876481, 536876493, 536876521, 536876557, 536876616, 536876623, 536876625, 536876654, 536876680, 536876701, 536876854, 536876895, 536876896, 536877043, 536877173, 536877268, 536877316, 536877320, 536877341, 536877344, 536877371, 536877385, 536877389, 536877390, 536877392, 536877393, 536877542, 536877587, 536877704, 536877844, 536877864, 536878041, 536878063, 536878065, 536878066, 536878067, 536878141, 536878231, 536878318, 536878339, 536878463, 536878482, 536878565, 536878589, 536878590, 536879027, 536879029, 536879645, 536879958, 536880098, 536880241, 536880565, 536880644, 536881628, 536882255, 536882256, 536894768]","[31, 43]",1906.0,79.08882591364889,250.0,https://www.igdb.com/games/gone-home

In the blink of an eye, everything is taken from you – your friends, your family, and even your own life.

Interactive Entertainment, which takes place in the world of J.R.R. Tolkien's Legendarium. 
 
The game takes place in the 60-year gap between the events of Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings. It is a story of revenge, slaughter, and mystery set entirely in Mordor, the Land of Shadows. At its center is Talion, an ordinary man who loses everything, including his mortal life. 
 
The game is set in a fully open world, and features various role-playing game elements such as experience points and skills. There are various ways the player can complete their main objective. Aside from the main storyline, there are various side quests and random events the player can complete within Mordor. 
 
The melee system is inspired by that of the Batman Arkham series. Getting into a good fighting rhythm, using both regular attacks and counter-attacks will improve the player's combo multiplier. 
 
A unique feature of Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is the Nemesis system. Every enemy in the game has their own name, rank, and memory. These enemies will continue to do their own jobs and tasks even when they're off screen. If the player does not kill an enemy in an encounter, this enemy will remember the player and change their tactics and conversations based on the encounter.","[1, 17, 18, 22, 23, 38, 268435468, 268435487, 536870928, 536870934, 536870976, 536870990, 536871006, 536871008, 536871029, 536871044, 536871063, 536871117, 536871139, 536871208, 536871213, 536871244, 536871301, 536871402, 536871504, 536871506, 536871535, 536871784, 536871882, 536871939, 536871945, 536872070, 536872205, 536872222, 536872225, 536872257, 536872371, 536872393, 536872406, 536872419, 536872628, 536872668, 536872849, 536872883, 536872898, 536872978, 536873053, 536873079, 536873154, 536873162, 536873192, 536873326, 536873327, 536873384, 536873914, 536873999, 536874115, 536874134, 536874706, 536874743, 536874822, 536874831, 536874916, 536875046, 536875047, 536875050, 536875062, 536875073, 536875081, 536875157, 536875197, 536875199, 536875228, 536875229, 536875231, 536875243, 536875257, 536875265, 536875266, 536875271, 536875294, 536875304, 536875306, 536875307, 536875308, 536875316, 536875324, 536875385, 536875437, 536875453, 536875455, 536875485, 536875490, 536875492, 536875494, 536875496, 536875523, 536875536, 536875623, 536875657, 536875668, 536875695, 536875755, 536875760, 536875762, 536875776, 536875781, 536875782, 536875792, 536875804, 536875808, 536875822, 536875830, 536875831, 536875889, 536876007, 536876078, 536876171, 536876174, 536876217, 536876220, 536876227, 536876228, 536876229, 536876266, 536876273, 536876276, 536876281, 536876321, 536876355, 536876495, 536876601, 536876650, 536876704, 536876706, 536876712, 536876723, 536876755, 536876813, 536876826, 536876911, 536876938, 536876942, 536876964, 536877032, 536877047, 536877077, 536877109, 536877111, 536877125, 536877221, 536877275, 536877383, 536877495, 536877595, 536877597, 536877600, 536877649, 536877762, 536877955, 536878064, 536878246, 536878257, 536878264, 536878277, 536878329, 536878372, 536879011, 536879066, 536879174, 536879751, 536880068, 536880168, 536880205, 536880206, 536880207, 536880285, 536880286, 536880287, 536880288, 536880289, 536880290, 536880292, 536890625, 536890626]","[1, 17, 18, 22, 23, 38]",3025.0,82.25933299951964,657.0,https://www.igdb.com/games/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor

As she traverses the globe, Jodie will face incredible challenges set against a backdrop of emotionally-charged events never before seen in a video game. Create your own personal journey as your decisions and actions shape the course of the story.","This is an action game in which players assume the role of Jodie Holmes and her invisible companion ""Aiden"" through fifteen years of Jodie's life. From a third-person perspective, players control Jodie through fully interactive environments, choosing a variety of action-, dialogue-, and decision-paths based on on-screen prompts. Some choices can lead to depictions of violence: Jodie attacking assailants with punches, kicks, and various objects (e.g., tree branches and knives; impaling an enemy with a pipe). As the character Aiden, players solve puzzles, manipulate objects and attack (e.g., strangulation) Jodie's assailants. Players can also use Aiden to possess enemies and perform violent acts (e.g., shooting fellow SWAT members; crashing vehicles; performing self-inflicted gunshot wounds). Some of these sequences are accompanied by blood-splatter effects. In one cutscene, a bound character's eye is cut out during an interrogation—the act is obscured by a character's back. One prolonged bar sequence depicts three men attempting to rape a woman; players control Aiden and interact with objects to stop the assailants.

As Joel and Ellie struggle to persevere, they must learn to trust each other and work together in order to survive the realities of this new world.","A third person shooter/stealth/survival hybrid, in which twenty years after the outbreak of a parasitic fungus which takes over the neural functions of humans, Joel, a Texan with a tragic familial past, finds himself responsible with smuggling a fourteen year old girl named Ellie to a militia group called the Fireflies, while avoiding strict and deadly authorities, infected fungal hosts and other violent survivors.","[1, 19, 21, 23, 268435461, 268435487, 536870976, 536870981, 536871044, 536871071, 536871073, 536871133, 536871134, 536871195, 536871251, 536871292, 536871422, 536871470, 536871535, 536871701, 536871889, 536871937, 536871945, 536872032, 536872184, 536872229, 536872232, 536872234, 536872245, 536872285, 536872315, 536872352, 536872511, 536872622, 536872647, 536872715, 536872748, 536872758, 536872847, 536872883, 536872952, 536873097, 536873192, 536873326, 536873584, 536873712, 536873810, 536874014, 536874182, 536874345, 536874398, 536874452, 536874706, 536874745, 536874822, 536874834, 536874906, 536875057, 536875097, 536875133, 536875151, 536875154, 536875157, 536875162, 536875194, 536875196, 536875199, 536875216, 536875229, 536875280, 536875304, 536875305, 536875320, 536875340, 536875342, 536875345, 536875358, 536875385, 536875420, 536875437, 536875438, 536875453, 536875456, 536875483, 536875491, 536875501, 536875523, 536875526, 536875527, 536875532, 536875535, 536875538, 536875540, 536875545, 536875549, 536875553, 536875554, 536875572, 536875623, 536875624, 536875668, 536875669, 536875695, 536875731, 536875741, 536875755, 536875762, 536875765, 536875777, 536875786, 536875803, 536875808, 536875819, 536875830, 536875831, 536875837, 536875886, 536875900, 536875902, 536876062, 536876073, 536876109, 536876171, 536876176, 536876188, 536876220, 536876227, 536876229, 536876241, 536876251, 536876262, 536876322, 536876329, 536876332, 536876337, 536876363, 536876384, 536876397, 536876414, 536876417, 536876439, 536876466, 536876483, 536876499, 536876502, 536876505, 536876520, 536876577, 536876584, 536876587, 536876596, 536876652, 536876670, 536876703, 536876706, 536876712, 536876727, 536876735, 536876759, 536876760, 536876797, 536876911, 536876978, 536876987, 536877015, 536877040, 536877047, 536877081, 536877109, 536877122, 536877128, 536877151, 536877157, 536877166, 536877169, 536877173, 536877203, 536877221, 536877283, 536877288, 536877289, 536877290, 536877309, 536877319, 536877321, 536877329, 536877332, 536877352, 536877374, 536877383, 536877393, 536877439, 536877453, 536877501, 536877516, 536877532, 536877560, 536877625, 536877643, 536877649, 536877657, 536877688, 536877762, 536877780, 536877782, 536877790, 536877809, 536877910, 536877942, 536877960, 536877976, 536877977, 536877985, 536878009, 536878027, 536878032, 536878057, 536878141, 536878215, 536878247, 536878263, 536878267, 536878315, 536878317, 536878331, 536878415, 536878468, 536878512, 536878515, 536878541, 536878562, 536879045, 536879069, 536879233, 536879734, 536879750, 536879766, 536879806, 536879824, 536879908, 536880073, 536880195, 536880240, 536880278, 536880319, 536880400, 536880449, 536880573, 536880680, 536880721, 536880732, 536881102, 536881103, 536881389, 536881602, 536882193, 536882489, 536882490, 536882491, 536882492, 536882493, 536882494, 536887629, 536888127, 536890349, 536891386]","[1, 19, 21, 23]",1009.0,93.07259963047045,1364.0,https://www.igdb.com/games/the-last-of-us

The Global Relief Effort (GRE) assists survivors still trapped in the city by regularly airdropping supplies. The GRE hires Kyle Crane to infiltrate Harran in order to retrieve a sensitive file stolen from them by Kadir Suleiman, which he is using as leverage to blackmail them, with the threat of publicizing it if anything were to happen to him. Crane is airdropped into Harran, where he is ambushed by a gang of hostile bandits. As the infected attack, Crane is bitten and infected, but rescued by Jade Aldemir and Amir Ghoreyshi. Amir sacrifices himself to buy Jade and Crane time, and Jade takes him to a survivor sanctuary called the Tower. Crane wakes up and is introduced to Rahim Aldemir, Jade's brother. Rahim then teaches Crane parkour and sends him to Spike, who gives him his first task as a resident of the tower. Crane learns that the Tower, which seeks to help other survivors, is being harassed by a gang of bandits led by a warlord named Rais who steals and hoards the supplies from the GRE airdrops, including Antizin; a vaccine that suppresses symptoms of infection and keeps bitten people from turning into the infected. After Harris Brecken, leader of the tower is nearly killed by a rival runner in a mission to retrieve an Antizin drop, need for the drug becomes immense. Crane volunteers and manages to reach an airdrop containing Antizin, but despite the dire need of the vaccine by the survivors, Crane is instructed by the GRE to destroy the airdrop, instructing him to reach out to Rais in order to buy the vaccine in order to confirm his identity. Crane reluctantly complies and informs the Tower that the supplies have been looted. 
 
Upset, Brecken tasks Crane with the job of making a deal with Rais. Upon meeting Rais, Crane is able to confirm that he is indeed Suleiman. He carries out a series of unethical tasks for Rais under the assumption that he will be rewarded with two crates of Antizin. Crane is unable to locate the file, and is later betrayed by Rais, who only gives him five vials of Antizin. He later breaks off business with the GRE when they halt the supply drops and refuse to help the Tower. The situation in the tower worsens, and a whole floor is sealed off when an outbreak occurs. While doing an errand, Rahim tells Crane that he and Omar were planning to bomb an infected nest. Crane is opposed to this plan. After an argument over the radio, he gives chase to a fleeing Rahim. Upon catching up to him, he finds that Omar is dead, while Rahim has been wounded. He then executes Rahim's plans, resulting in the killing of the infected in the compound. When he gets back to Rahim he discovers that he was actually bitten and had turned while Crane was gone, forcing Crane to respectfully snap Rahim's neck when he attacks him. When Crane returns to the tower to inform Brecken of the news, Jade overhears them, and visibly upset, takes off. 
 
Meanwhile, a scientist at the Tower named Dr. Imran Zere, who was attempting to develop a cure for the virus, is kidnapped by Rais, prompting Crane to attempt a rescue mission. Crane is also captured by Rais, who reveals that the file he stole contains proof that the GRE intends to weaponize the virus rather than develop a cure and releases the file to the public. Crane manages to escape before being executed, resulting in Rais losing one of his hands during the process. Dr. Zere is killed in the rescue attempt, but manages to tell Crane that he had entrusted his research to Jade, who is tasked with delivering it to another scientist named Dr. Allen Camden. As Crane goes to look for Jade, he finds out that the Defense Ministry is planning to bomb Harran in an effort to completely eradicate the outbreak, claiming that there are no survivors left in the city. He manages to reactivate a radio tower and broadcasts a message to the outside world, thwarting the Ministry's plan. Jade was captured by Rais, who also steals Dr. Zere's research. Crane manages to rescue Jade and recover a part of Dr. Zere's research, but Jade admits that she has been bitten, and pleads with Crane to stop Rais. Jade then succumbs to the wound, forcing Crane to kill her. After killing Rais' assistant, Tair with his own machete, Crane delivers the tissue samples to Dr. Camden, who believes that he is very close to the cure, but needs the rest of Dr. Zere's data. Crane then finds out that Rais has cut a deal with the GRE, in which he will hand over Dr. Zere's research data to them in return for extraction from Harran. Crane then assaults Rais' headquarters (filled with infected) and battles him atop a skyscraper, eventually stabbing Rais in the neck and throwing him off the building. He recovers the research data and decides to turn it over to Dr. Camden instead of the GRE, intending to stay in Harran to help the survivors.","Dying Light is a first-person, action survival horror game set in a vast and dangerous open world. During the day, players traverse an expansive urban environment overrun by a vicious outbreak, scavenging the world for supplies and crafting weapons to defend against the growing infected population. At night, the hunter becomes the hunted, as the infected become aggressive and more dangerous. Most frightening are the predators which only appear after sundown. Players must use everything in their power to survive until the morning’s first light.","[1, 19, 21, 23, 38, 268435461, 268435468, 268435487, 536870917, 536870981, 536871041, 536871213, 536871251, 536871302, 536871365, 536871378, 536871422, 536871506, 536871510, 536871784, 536871938, 536872032, 536872070, 536872211, 536872257, 536872371, 536872511, 536872695, 536872715, 536872748, 536873192, 536873236, 536873352, 536873362, 536873364, 536873753, 536874706, 536874743, 536874813, 536874822, 536874834, 536874916, 536875046, 536875063, 536875073, 536875081, 536875091, 536875095, 536875098, 536875114, 536875131, 536875188, 536875192, 536875199, 536875232, 536875242, 536875257, 536875275, 536875281, 536875286, 536875315, 536875330, 536875340, 536875344, 536875345, 536875433, 536875440, 536875453, 536875455, 536875459, 536875490, 536875491, 536875492, 536875493, 536875494, 536875498, 536875500, 536875501, 536875502, 536875504, 536875506, 536875508, 536875510, 536875511, 536875513, 536875524, 536875527, 536875531, 536875532, 536875536, 536875545, 536875546, 536875547, 536875554, 536875564, 536875623, 536875635, 536875650, 536875668, 536875741, 536875743, 536875747, 536875764, 536875792, 536875804, 536875807, 536875808, 536875814, 536875815, 536875822, 536875830, 536875832, 536875852, 536875923, 536875951, 536876073, 536876083, 536876088, 536876097, 536876098, 536876108, 536876109, 536876126, 536876128, 536876129, 536876180, 536876183, 536876184, 536876217, 536876218, 536876229, 536876235, 536876242, 536876245, 536876281, 536876317, 536876332, 536876339, 536876344, 536876414, 536876432, 536876435, 536876456, 536876461, 536876462, 536876464, 536876476, 536876502, 536876538, 536876556, 536876575, 536876576, 536876606, 536876666, 536876683, 536876703, 536876757, 536876811, 536876851, 536876880, 536876987, 536876988, 536877031, 536877047, 536877109, 536877125, 536877159, 536877165, 536877167, 536877172, 536877180, 536877238, 536877290, 536877294, 536877334, 536877352, 536877390, 536877497, 536877499, 536877542, 536877640, 536877641, 536877642, 536877643, 536877644, 536877645, 536877646, 536877647, 536877648, 536877649, 536877650, 536877651, 536877652, 536877653, 536877654, 536881831]","[1, 19, 21, 23, 38]",3042.0,76.44220048733015,346.0,https://www.igdb.com/games/dying-light

Siberite and the artifact - named EON - are discovered by a U.S. expedition to Russia during World War I. EON is revealed to be a time machine capable of sending objects into the past, but by the time of the discovery, Siberite stocks are exhausted and research stops. Then in the new millennium vast deposits of the mineral are found in Siberia, and Americans are able to extract enough of it for small-scale time-travel.

The U.S. comes up with a plan to send a small force two million years back in time. There it will mine the Siberite and transport it over the Bering Land Bridge to Alaska, into what will one day be in American hands. The best troops are selected, briefed, and told that it is a one-way trip back through time.

This results in a new time line with the mineral located in Alaska and the U.S. being the only undisputed superpower thanks to the inexhaustible source of energy. Here the time machine wasn't found by the U.S. but the Russians instead. The USSR fumes under American supremacy. Frustration turns to outrage when Soviet scientists find traces of American settlement and Alaskite, the source of U.S. power, in remote Siberia. A Soviet expedition is sent through the EON, here called TAWAR, to repel the American thieves and preserve what is rightfully theirs.","An American geological expedition, under a UN mandate, assesses the natural resources in a distant part of Siberia, deep in the trackless steppes of Eastern Russia. But instead of oil, they discover a deposit of a hitherto unknown mineral. 
 
American scientists working for Department of Defense find out that this mineral is in fact identical to the substance used to power an extraterrestrial artifact in their possession. This object is called the EON (Extraterrestrial Object Nexus). 
 
It was found in 1919 by Colonel Emerson near the site of the Tunguska explosion. Emerson was the commander of a US military unit in charge of transporting US war supplies from the city of Vladivostok to the Eastern front during World War I. 
 
DoD Experiments have shown that items placed in the capsule are transported hundreds of thousands of years back in time. The American scientists were not able to understand its construction, nor could they manage to synthesize its fuel. Eventually, the machine - classified Top Secret - was stored, pending further advances in human science.","[17, 18, 22, 39, 268435460, 268435467, 268435471, 268435488, 536870913, 536870990, 536871019, 536871082, 536871251, 536871490, 536871515, 536871519, 536871737, 536871882, 536871938, 536872019, 536872225, 536872245, 536872282, 536872383, 536872733, 536872817, 536874182, 536874694, 536874947, 536875054, 536875067, 536875171, 536875358, 536875464, 536875484, 536875531, 536875559, 536875572, 536875624, 536875679, 536876262, 536876939, 536880540, 536880684]","[17, 18, 22, 39]",0.0,87.01767104244065,9.0,https://www.igdb.com/games/original-war--1

Lead the research race until 2034, create the best hardware and operating system, take care of your infrastructure and even handle your marketing.

Computer Tycoon is different from other building/tycoon games because it has a ""grand strategy game"" aspect. You will control your ""computer empire"" viewing a world map and managing resources. 
A journey through computer history 
Start your adventure in the 70s as a small business somewhere in the world. Learn more about hardware and software inventions that were the first steps to our current modern world, and get a taste of what is waiting for us in the future. Find the classic video games and help a new culture to be born. 
Create computers your way! 
In Computer Tycoon the decisions you make during development really matter. Take advantage of the technology, upgrade and design combinations! Does your product need more computing capacity or should you focus more on features, low price or prestige? Maybe change to portable computers or develop more easy-to-use Operating Systems? These decisions will have a major impact on the success of your company. 
Expand your multinational corporation 
Expand your corporation in a smart way into multiple countries, build more offices, factories, laboratories and other required facilities. Poor countries have cheaper labor, but richer countries will give you more educated engineers. 
Market your computers! 
Having the best product isn't enough. You must take care of people's needs or even ""change their needs"" using different marketing tools. Balance your budget well between development, production, marketing, and expansion. 
You have only one life 
We'll all die one day... but not in Computer Tycoon! You can win the game by becoming a monopoly or reaching the technological singularity if you are fast and healthy enough. Healthy? Yes, you have a small chance to die in the game, so you should regularly check your health.

The Wolves, a lethal ex–US Military unit of former Ghosts gone rogue, have taken over the island. Led by Nomad’s ex-brother-in-arms, Lt. Colonel Cole D. Walker, portrayed by Jon Bernthal, they have reprogrammed Skell’s drones into killing machines and are ready to use them, no matter the casualties.

A squadron of the Tekken Force searches an ancient temple located in Mexico. Soon after arriving there, Heihachi learns that they have been obliterated by Ogre. However, Heihachi, having witnessed the event, seeks to capture Ogre in hopes of harnessing its power for his own gain. Soon after, various martial artists end up dead, attacked or missing from all over the world, with Ogre behind it. 
 
Jun Kazama has been living a quiet life in Yakushima with her young son, Jin, fathered after the events of the previous tournament by Heihachi's son, Kazuya. However, their peaceful life is disrupted when Jun begins to feel the encroaching presence of Ogre. Jun is now a target and instructs Jin to seek Heihachi should anything happen. Sometime after Jin's fifteenth birthday, Ogre indeed attacks. Against Jun's wishes, Jin valiantly tries to fight Ogre off, but Ogre knocks him unconscious. When Jin awakens, he finds that his house has been burned to the ground, and that his mother is missing and most likely dead. Driven by revenge, Jin is confronted by the Devil, which brands Jin's left arm and possesses him. Jin goes to Heihachi, explaining his situation and identity and begging him for training to become strong enough to face Ogre. Heihachi accepts and takes Jin in, as well as sending him to school. 
 
Four years later, Jin masters the Mishima karate style. On Jin's nineteenth birthday, Heihachi announces the King of the Iron Fist Tournament 3, secretly intending to lure out Ogre, while Jin prepares for his upcoming battle. 
 
In the tournament, at a large temple, Paul Phoenix defeats Ogre and walks away from the tournament, thinking he is victorious. However, Ogre transforms into its true form of a monstrous beast, and Jin finally confronts it. Jin battles and defeats Ogre, and the being completely dissolves. However, Jin is suddenly gunned down by a squadron of Tekken Forces led by Heihachi, who, no longer needing him, personally fires a final shot into his grandson's head. 
 
However, Jin, revived by the Devil within him, reawakens and dispatches the soldiers, smashing Heihachi through the wall of the temple. Heihachi survives the long fall, looking up to see Jin sprout feathery wings and fly off into the night.","Tekken 3 maintains the same core fighting system and concept as its predecessors, but brings many improvements, such as significantly more detailed graphics and animations, fifteen new characters added to the game's roster, more modern music and faster and more fluid gameplay. 
Perhaps the most noticeable change from Tekken 2 fight system is movement reform - whereas the element of depth had been largely insignificant in previous Tekken games (aside from some characters having unique sidesteps and dodging maneuvers), Tekken 3 added emphasis on the third axis, allowing all characters to sidestep in or out of the background by lightly pressing the arcade stick (or tapping the controller button in the console version) towards the corresponding direction. Another big change in movement was that jumping was toned down, no longer allowing fighters to jump to extreme heights (as was present in previous games), but keeping leaps to reasonable, realistic heights. It made air combat more controllable, and put more use to sidestep dodges, as jumping no longer became a universal dodge move that was flying above all of the ground moves. Other than that, the improved engine allowed for quick recoveries from knock-downs, more escapes from tackles and stuns, better juggling (as many old moves had changed parameters, allowing them to connect in combo-situations, where they wouldn't connect in previous games) and extra newly created combo throws. 
 
Tekken 3 was the first Tekken to feature a beat 'em up minigame called ""Tekken Force"", which pitted the player in various stages against enemies in a side-scrolling fashion. If the player succeeds in beating the minigame four times, Dr. Bosconovitch would be a playable character (granted that you defeat him first).

Players can choose between a variety of classes, with ten classes released and an upcoming one, as of May 2014. The players can freely customize their character or avatar with many choices of hair styles and faces and much more. It is then proceeded with the choice of four Eidolons, who will accompany the player throughout the game, while also giving the ability to earn other Eidolons.
Within the game, the player can interact with many non-player characters and enter combat mode with monsters outside of the hub world. The combat system is primarily the player using a wide variety of skills corresponding with the class against the monsters, who also have their own set of skills. The majority of the game is to simply attack and defeat the monsters along the way while partaking quests. The combat system is unique in a way that, although the player has to click on a monster to engage in combat, the player also has the ability to move to dodge and use their skills in a variety of ways. With an accompanying Eidolon, the player's Eidolon can also fight alongside their character, and also use a combination attack. The combat system is not merely a ""click-and-watch"" combat. Outside of the combat system, the player can also engage in several different tasks, such as fishing, crafting, and many more.

While the game is situated in a free-to-play environment, the game also allows the players to purchase Aeria Points, or for short AP, that allows the players to use that monetary value for special in-game items found in the Item Mall. Otherwise, the game uses the gold and silver tactic, which can be acquired a number of ways. The game also allows the use of trade, a self-installed stall in Navea, and the Auction House. Players can also use the mailing system to mail other players using the cash-on-delivery system.","[1, 17, 22, 268435468, 268435487, 536870990, 536871004, 536871208, 536871390, 536871784, 536871812, 536872070, 536872245, 536872296, 536873297, 536875046, 536875281, 536875735, 536875799]","[1, 17, 22]",0.0,58.7493067110372,10.0,https://www.igdb.com/games/aura-kingdom

The currents that buffet the many diverse plants and animals that live there also carry with them stories of long lost civilizations; of love and war, change and loss. 
 
From lush, green kelp forests to dark caves, exploring will be no easy task. But the splendor of the undersea world awaits Naija... and you. 
 
Open Waters	 
CRYSTALLINE BLUE 
 
The glassy waters of the open sea let you peer far into the distance, and fish and other creatures play beneath the wide canopies of giant, undersea mushrooms. 
 
Here, ruins serve as a clue to Aquaria's long past. Will they lead Naija to the truth? 
 
The Kelp Forest	 
THE NATURAL WORLD 
 
The kelp forest teems with life. As light from above pours across the multitudes of strange plants and animals that live here, one cannot help but marvel at the dynamic landscape. 
 
But beware, its beauty belies the inherent danger inside. Careful not to lose your way. 
 
The Abyss	 
DARKNESS 
 
As you swim deeper, to where sight cannot reach, the Abyss begins to swallow you whole. The deeper waters of Aquaria have spawned legends of frightening monstrosities that lurk where few things can survive. Are they true? 
 
Beyond	 
??? 
 
What lies beyond? Are there areas deeper than the Abyss? Or as we swim ever upward, can we find the source of the light? 
 
Only those with great fortitude will come to know and understand the mysteries of Aquaria.","AN UNDERWATER FANTASY WORLD TO EXPLORE 
 
A massive ocean world, teeming with life and filled with ancient secrets. Join Naija, a lone underwater dweller in search of her family, as she explores the depths of Aquaria. She'll travel from hidden caves, shrouded in darkness, to beautiful, sunlit oases, all lovingly handcrafted by its two creators. 
 
Naija's story, narrated fully with voice overs, will become yours, as you join her on this magnificent adventure. 
 
MAGIC AND COMBAT AT A MOUSE-CLICK 
 
Naija has the gift of the Verse. By singing songs, she can weave this force to change the waters around her. With each song Naija learns comes new abilities. With powerful songs, Naija is able to change form, giving players many options as to how to play the game. 
 
And with Aquaria's intuitive mouse-only control system, it's as easy to make Naija swim gracefully through the waters as it is to have her sing, cast spells, and engage in combat with the numerous dangerous creatures that inhabit Aquaria's waters. 
 
The Xbox 360 controller and FPS style mouse / keyboard controls are also supported. 
 
 
CREATE YOUR OWN WORLDS

Dragons now darken the sky, casting a shadow of terror over a once-peaceful kingdom. Mages have broken into an all-out war against the oppressive Templars. Nations rise against one another. It falls to you to restore order as you lead the Inquisition and hunt down the agents of chaos - your choices will forever change the Dragon Age.","When the sky opens up and rains down chaos, the world needs heroes. Become the savior of Thedas in Dragon Age: Inquisition. You are the Inquisitor, tasked with saving the world from itself. But the road ahead is paved with difficult decisions. Thedas is a land of strife. Factions constantly war with each other even as a larger demonic invasion has begun. And you? You and your band of champions are the only ones who can hold it together. It’s your job to lead them… or fall. 
 
Enthralling, Choice-driven Narrative – You’re not just deciding who to send into which battle in Inquisition, you’re making important decisions that shape the future of Thedas. Each choice carries weight, and your actions can lead to a variety of outcomes. Inquisition is a highly personalized journey, where one wrong move could set in motion a series of events that alter the physical aspects of the world itself, making your Thedas – and your heroes – feel truly unique. 
 
A Massive World to Discover – The world of Thedas has never been bigger or more detailed; it’s wide open, and ripe for exploration. Discover enemy keeps ripe for the taking. Unearth hidden caves filled with lurking creatures. Thedas is vast and dangerous, but uncovering its secrets can spell the difference between victory and defeat. 
 
Intense, Strategic Combat – There’s no wrong way to play Dragon Age: Inquisition… except for the way that gets you killed. Fortunately, the optional strategic view gives you a god’s-eye vantage on battle. Time stops while you plan in this view, but if that’s not your style, you can just barrel ahead, crossbows blazing.","[1, 17, 22, 268435468, 268435480, 268435487, 536871059, 536871063, 536871131, 536871139, 536871208, 536871244, 536871390, 536871504, 536871506, 536871535, 536871758, 536871938, 536872246, 536872371, 536872622, 536872626, 536872649, 536872798, 536872799, 536872873, 536872978, 536872983, 536873154, 536873384, 536873914, 536874706, 536874813, 536875046, 536875095, 536875184, 536875199, 536875228, 536875229, 536875265, 536875275, 536875276, 536875281, 536875432, 536875437, 536875453, 536875464, 536875492, 536875537, 536875611, 536875657, 536875668, 536875695, 536875735, 536875755, 536875760, 536875764, 536875792, 536875808, 536875830, 536875831, 536876007, 536876062, 536876099, 536876109, 536876211, 536876217, 536876228, 536876229, 536876235, 536876239, 536876274, 536876329, 536876392, 536876476, 536876556, 536876621, 536876706, 536876770, 536876889, 536876976, 536877032, 536877053, 536877111, 536877153, 536877165, 536877191, 536877303, 536877565, 536878000, 536878263, 536878488, 536879059, 536879064, 536879083, 536880960, 536882922, 536882923, 536882924, 536890600, 536890601, 536890602, 536890603, 536890604, 536890605, 536890606]","[1, 17, 22]",1887.0,86.1716208285378,599.0,https://www.igdb.com/games/dragon-age-inquisition

Seed believes that he has been chosen to protect the people of Hope County from an ""inevitable collapse"" and has established a congregation called Eden's Gate. Ostensibly, this is to fulfill his mission of leading the people to salvation; in reality, Seed is a radical preacher and Eden's Gate is a militaristic doomsday cult. Under his rule, Eden's Gate has used both coercion and violence to forcibly convert the residents of Hope County, and intimidation to keep them from contacting the federal government for help. When an attempt to arrest Seed ends with the deaths of several lawmen, the player is swept into the armed conflict between Eden's Gate and the remaining Hope County residents who are organizing themselves into a resistance movement. The player takes on the role of a sheriff's deputy who is sent to Hope County to arrest Seed. Seed has assumed the title of ""the Father"" and maintains control over Hope County with the aid of his siblings, known as ""the Heralds"": Jacob, a former military officer that oversees their armed soldiers; John, a lawyer that has been able to acquire much of the land in Hope County for Eden's Gate; and Faith, who acts as a pacifist to bring the people to believe and trust in her older brother. The residents of Hope County opposed to Seed include Pastor Jerome, a local church leader that has seen his congregation taken by Eden's Gate; Mary May, a bartender whose father was murdered by the cult; and Nick Rye, a cropduster pilot who wants to eliminate the influence of the cult in order to build a better future for his children.","Welcome to Hope County, Montana, land of the free and the brave, but also home to a fanatical doomsday cult known as The Project at Eden’s Gate that is threatening the community's freedom.

But all does not go smoothly upon his arrival in the glamorous, hedonistic metropolis of Vice City. He's set up and is left with no money and no merchandise.

For the sake of mankind and our future, join us...","Girls' Frontline is a moe anthropomorphism game in which the player controls echelons of android characters, known in-game as ""T-Dolls"" or ""Tactical Dolls"", each of which represents a real-world firearm. 
 The player plays as a newly recruited commander of an area who commands the T-Dolls in battle, and organises the echelons as well as the T-Dolls' wellbeing. Battles are a mix of turn-based strategy puzzles on a set map with enemies that can move about, random item nodes and heliports/command nodes, from which the player can summon their own echelons, or support echelons, which are echelons that the player's friend sets on their profile to be used by others, and real-time battles with enemy echelons. Battles are for the most part automated, although the player can activate the T-Dolls' special abilities manually if wanted, or order them to different spots in formation (which the player can organise out of battle to be set as the default formation when entering a battle) or to withdraw in order to conserve health or resources). Players also have the option of withdrawing specific echelons from the mission altogether if they wish. Gameplay progresses by playing on the campaign missions, logistic support missions, or combat simulations to level up each T-Doll. The game also features gacha elements, such as in the production and heavy production of T-Dolls and equipment, or in the Dormitory with costumes and furniture sets for the T-Dolls on a time-limited basis with several sets and costumes being available for a limited time, before another few sets and costumes are revealed and added. After a while, old costumes from previous gacha events will be added to the ""Black Card"" store, where players can exchange an amount of Black Cards (obtained from gifting T-Dolls a duplicate costume that has already been gifted before) for a costume of a previous gacha set. Players can customise their dorms with furniture, and interact with Chibi renditions of the T-Dolls in the echelon corresponding with that dorm. They can also gift the T-Dolls food and costume, which raises the affection of the T-Dolls. Affection is also gained from success in battle, and is lost when the T-Dolls die (unless it is a boss battle) or when another T-Doll in the same echelon dies.","[1, 268435461, 268435467, 268435471, 536870913, 536870990, 536871937, 536875171]",[1],0.0,46.034484000000006,1.0,https://www.igdb.com/games/girls-frontline

He created the humans, and the Balaur to safeguard and watch over them. Eventually, the Balaur became obsessed with power and subjugation.

When Aion refused to grant them the power they desired, the power to rival his own, they revolted and declared war on the god that created them. Aion's hand was forced, and he created the twelve Empyrean Lords, beings of divinity and power to protect the Tower of Eternity. 
 
Some humans ""ascended"" to become Daeva and, like the Empyrean Lords, had wings and the ability to fight the Balaur. With time, enough Daevas rose to form an army. The Empyrean Lords would lead the Daeva into battle and fight ceaselessly. Eventually an attempt at peace with the Balaur was made. The five Drakan Lords were invited inside the barrier for peace talks, but before the peace-talks could begin, one of the Drakan Lords was nearly assassinated by an unknown assailant. In the fighting that followed, the Tower of Eternity was destroyed, resulting in the cataclysm that broke Atreia in half. Five Empyrean Lords, most of whom opposed the peace treaty, came to power in the dark part of the world, ""Asmodae,"" and became known as the Shedim Lords. Another five who had mostly desired peace became the Seraphim Lords and ruled over the lower half of Atreia, ""Elysea."" Two of the Empyrean Lords sacrificed themselves to keep Atreia from crumbling entirely. 
 
Those that lived in the light part of the world, the Elyos, saw little change. These followers of the Seraphim Lords created the city of Sanctum. The inhabitants of the upper part, the Asmodians, saw many changes. Their hands became claw-like, their feet became talons.

In LIFE IS STRANGE the player has the power to affect the game’s narrative and also change the course of history itself.","[1, 17, 18, 31, 268435468, 268435487, 536870938, 536870939, 536870984, 536871082, 536871183, 536871470, 536871738, 536871813, 536871874, 536871878, 536871882, 536871939, 536871945, 536871991, 536872140, 536872184, 536872205, 536872638, 536872695, 536872746, 536873318, 536873486, 536873658, 536873907, 536874706, 536875006, 536875046, 536875057, 536875092, 536875098, 536875110, 536875114, 536875132, 536875153, 536875157, 536875199, 536875216, 536875229, 536875256, 536875257, 536875265, 536875271, 536875326, 536875330, 536875344, 536875358, 536875420, 536875437, 536875494, 536875498, 536875504, 536875506, 536875511, 536875513, 536875515, 536875523, 536875537, 536875545, 536875552, 536875572, 536875637, 536875645, 536875649, 536875650, 536875678, 536875695, 536875700, 536875708, 536875741, 536875742, 536875743, 536875745, 536875747, 536875749, 536875767, 536875781, 536875782, 536875831, 536875880, 536875885, 536875887, 536875889, 536875923, 536876072, 536876073, 536876098, 536876108, 536876109, 536876128, 536876129, 536876134, 536876178, 536876180, 536876188, 536876229, 536876241, 536876274, 536876291, 536876292, 536876317, 536876322, 536876332, 536876333, 536876335, 536876336, 536876338, 536876344, 536876372, 536876456, 536876459, 536876461, 536876473, 536876616, 536876617, 536876625, 536876711, 536876767, 536876821, 536876867, 536876901, 536876922, 536876923, 536876924, 536876932, 536876968, 536877029, 536877173, 536877183, 536877268, 536877337, 536877340, 536877341, 536877345, 536877361, 536877624, 536878100, 536878426, 536878584, 536879192, 536879824, 536879879, 536880062, 536880164, 536880884, 536881450, 536881451, 536881452, 536881453, 536881454, 536881455, 536890500]","[1, 17, 18, 31]",7599.0,81.98752019013145,882.0,https://www.igdb.com/games/life-is-strange

The player's character begins on a sand dune in a seemingly endless desert. In the far distance looms a large, foreboding mountain with a glowing crevice that splits its peak. As the character approaches the mountain, they find remnants of a once-thriving civilization, eroded by sand over time. Scattered throughout the ruins at the end of each area are stones at which the traveler rests; these give the traveler the vision of meeting a larger, white-robed figure in a circular room, with art on the walls describing the rise and fall of the civilization, mirroring the player's journey.

The player continues to journey deeper into the remains of a once sprawling city at the base of the mountain. Eventually making it safely to the mountain, the traveler begins to climb it, struggling as they enter the colder climates and encounter deep snow and high winds. With the crevice still a fair distance away, the traveler falls and collapses in the snow. Six of the white-robed figures appear and grant the traveler new energy, allowing the player to reach the summit of the mountain and walk into and through the crevice as the screen fills with white. The player is then shown the game's credits, playing over the ending cinematic. This cinematic shows a shooting star emanating from the crevice and traversing the path the traveler took through the ruins, and shows glimpses of other robed travelers heading towards the mountain. Eventually, the star comes to rest at the sand dune where the game began, and the player is given the option of starting the game again. As the credits end, the player is shown the PlayStation Network IDs of the other travelers who shared part of the trek.","In Journey the player controls a robed figure in a vast desert, traveling towards a mountain in the distance. Other players on the same journey can be discovered, and two players can meet and assist each other, but they cannot communicate via speech or text and cannot see each other's names. The only form of communication between the two is a musical chime. This chime also transforms dull, stiff pieces of cloth found throughout the levels into vibrant red, affecting the game world and allowing the player to progress through the levels. The robed figure wears a trailing scarf, which when charged by approaching floating pieces of cloth, briefly allows the player to float through the air.

The developers sought to evoke in the player a sense of smallness and wonder, and to forge an emotional connection between them and the anonymous players they meet along the way. The music, composed by Austin Wintory, dynamically responds to the player's actions, building a single theme to represent the game's emotional arc throughout the story. Reviewers of the game praised the visual and auditory art as well as the sense of companionship created by playing with a stranger, calling it a moving and emotional experience. Journey won several ""game of the year"" awards and received several other awards and nominations, including a Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media nomination for the 2013 Grammy Awards.","[1, 268435463, 268435464, 268435468, 268435487, 268435488, 536871029, 536871208, 536871444, 536871529, 536871904, 536871939, 536872010, 536872349, 536872622, 536872961, 536873111, 536873249, 536873455, 536873712, 536874022, 536875083, 536875099, 536875151, 536875157, 536875194, 536875208, 536875271, 536875276, 536875322, 536875350, 536875437, 536875453, 536875610, 536875638, 536875695, 536875809, 536876015, 536876023, 536876069, 536876185, 536876229, 536876445, 536876540, 536876714, 536876751, 536876808, 536877057, 536877238, 536877384, 536877549, 536878284, 536878381, 536878488, 536878512, 536878531, 536879091, 536880854, 536880863, 536881002, 536881123, 536881414, 536882058, 536882159, 536882425, 536882616, 536883374, 536883375, 536883555, 536888127, 536890230, 536894294]",[1],1352.0,89.95268114308635,454.0,https://www.igdb.com/games/journey

The Emperor is unwell and Lord Richard Northburgh, cousin and treasurer of the Emperor, is building a magnificent Cathedral to pray for the Emperor's health. Meanwhile, Cardinal Lucius is making preparations for a Crusade against the Saracens of the Orient, aided by Guy Forcas. 
 
In the first few chapters of the campaign, the player learns the basics of game-play and the economy by assisting Northburgh and Forcas with supply and construction tasks, as well as meeting some of the other main characters. 
 
As the Crusader ships leave the harbour, Northburgh begins to uncover clues to a mysterious plot. He and the player travel to the Orient and befriend the Grand Vizier of the Sultan, Al Zahir, who helps the player to defeat a band of Corsairs and break up a child trafficking scheme. The plot thickens as further clues reveal that a main character is implicated in a sinister conspiracy to overthrow the Emperor himself. Because he comes too close to the truth, Lord Northburgh is captured and the player is tasked with unravelling the mystery. 
 
Over the next several chapters, the player must win over new allies, convince the leaders of the Crusade that they are being manipulated under false pretenses, and survive dire circumstances in order to defeat the villains and restore the Emperor to his rightful place. 
 
The campaign is divided into eight chapters and each chapter can be played on 3 different difficulties: easy, medium, and hard. Apart from the story elements, the campaign serves as a tutorial to prepare the player for the more rigorous scenarios and continuous game modes. 
 
All of the main characters encountered in the campaign are also encountered in the scenarios mode and can be selected as computer opponents in continuous games, although the actions of the characters during the campaign are unrelated to their actions in these modes apart from having similar personalities. Lord Northburgh and Al Zahir act as mentors and trade partners in the other modes, much like they do in the campaign.","Anno 1404 is a city-building and economic simulation game with real-time strategy elements. Released in 2009, it was developed by Related Designs, produced by Blue Byte, and published by Ubisoft. Though the game centers on a series of fictional events, the overall concept of the storyline is based upon real life aspects of medieval and renaissance history such as the Crusades, advancements in gothic architecture, construction of cathedrals, and hanseatic trade involving the rise of patrician merchants and early forms of capitalism.","[17, 22, 268435467, 268435469, 268435471, 268435487, 536870972, 536871304, 536871506, 536871518, 536871561, 536871906, 536872015, 536872060, 536872070, 536872383, 536872544, 536872640, 536872649, 536873822, 536874445, 536874694, 536875067, 536875679, 536875784, 536875910, 536876237, 536876274, 536876281, 536876330, 536876695, 536877079, 536877144, 536877557, 536877679, 536878484, 536879058, 536880294, 536882386]","[17, 22]",0.0,76.21839779053705,80.0,https://www.igdb.com/games/anno-1404

Warlords Battlecry III continue to perfect its automated feature system, greatly reducing gameplay micromanagement and quickly proving to be the holy grail of RTS games among gamers of the genre.

Extra features included in Warlords Battlecry III are specifically geared to please the legions of previous Battlecry players, including the removal of hero and unit caps, the addition of new special abilities for high-level heroes and the creation of an intuitive hero system. All of these features, coupled with new races and hero classes, new spells and items, and new building and dragons meld to form a Real-Time Strategy game that once again raises the benchmark for other games in the genre.

He must rescue Elizabeth, a mysterious girl imprisoned since childhood and locked up in the flying city of Columbia. Forced to trust one another, Booker and Elizabeth form a powerful bond during their daring escape. Together, they learn to harness an expanding arsenal of weapons and abilities, as they fight on zeppelins in the clouds, along high-speed Sky-Lines, and down in the streets of Columbia, all while surviving the threats of the air-city and uncovering its dark secret.","This first-person story-driven shooter and entry in the Bioshock franchise follows Booker DeWitt as he enters the floating independent (formerly US) city of Columbia in 1912 and attempts to retrieve a girl trapped in a tower by the city's self-proclaimed despot/prophet in order to erase his financial debt. Throughout the story, themes of violence, racism and fatalism are brought up.","[1, 17, 18, 19, 22, 31, 268435461, 268435487, 536870934, 536871041, 536871082, 536871195, 536871226, 536871341,

Hugo Strange discloses his knowledge of Wayne's dual identity as Batman before releasing him into the prison's criminal populace. While Strange prepares to commence ""Protocol 10"", Wayne obtains his equipment via airdrop from Alfred Pennyworth, allowing him to become Batman. He first saves Catwoman from being executed by Two-Face, who hopes to gain respect by murdering her. After Joker attempts to assassinate Catwoman, Batman tracks him to his hideout in the Sionis Steelmill, believing Joker may know the truth behind Protocol 10. 
 
There, Batman learns that the unstable properties of the Titan formula are mutating in Joker's blood, gradually killing him. Joker captures Batman and performs a blood transfusion on him, infecting him with the same fatal disease. Joker also reveals that Gotham hospitals have been poisoned with his infected blood. Desperate to save himself and innocent citizens, Batman seeks out Mr. Freeze, who had been developing a cure but has since been kidnapped by the Penguin. 
 
Tracking Penguin to the Cyrus Pinkney National History Institute, Batman defeats his forces, his imprisoned monster Solomon Grundy, and ultimately the Penguin himself, before liberating Mr. Freeze. Freeze tells Batman that he has already developed the cure, but its instability renders it useless. Batman deduces that the restorative properties of Ra's al Ghul's blood can complete the cure. Batman tracks one of Ra's al Ghul's assassins to his underground lair, leading Batman into a confrontation with Ra's and his daughter Talia, Batman's former lover. With Ra's al Ghul's blood, Freeze is able to develop an antidote, but it is stolen by Harley Quinn before Batman can use it. 
 
When he returns to the Joker, Batman finds him restored to health. While the two fight, Strange activates Protocol 10, which is revealed to be a scheme to wipe out the entire population of Arkham City and destroy the criminal element of Gotham. The TYGER troops begin executing inmates as Strange launches missile strikes on Arkham's denizens from his base in Wonder Tower. A missile hits the steelmill, burying Batman under rubble. Before Joker can take advantage of the situation, Talia arrives and offers him immortality in exchange for sparing Batman's life. After escaping with the help of Catwoman, Batman is convinced by Alfred to end Protocol 10 before pursuing Talia and Joker. 
 
Batman infiltrates Wonder Tower and disables Protocol 10. Ra's al Ghul is revealed to be the true mastermind behind Arkham City and mortally wounds Strange for failing to defeat Batman. With his dying breath, Strange activates ""Protocol 11"", the self-destruction of Wonder Tower. Batman and Ra's escape, but Ra's commits suicide rather than risk capture. Joker contacts Batman, threatening to kill Talia unless Batman meets him at the Monarch Theater. Once Batman arrives, Joker demands the cure but is stabbed and apparently killed by Talia while distracted. Talia admits to stealing the cure from Quinn, when she is killed by a second Joker, still stricken with the disease. The healthy Joker that Talia stabbed then reanimates into the shapeshifting Clayface, who is revealed to have been masquerading as a healthy Joker all along at the ailing villain's request. 
 
Batman incapacitates Clayface, but Joker blows up the theater floor, sending Batman plummeting into Ra's' lair below. Batman destroys Ra's' rejuvenating Lazarus Pit before the Joker can use it, and drinks a portion of the antidote. Batman debates curing his foe but is attacked by Joker before he can act, causing the antidote vial to inadvertently smash. Batman admits that in spite of everything Joker had done, he would have saved him. After Joker finally succumbs to his illness and dies, Batman carries his body out of Arkham City. As Commissioner Gordon asks what happened, Batman places Joker's body on the hood of a police car and leaves in silence.","After the events of Batman: Arkham Asylum (2009), a section of the city of Gotham has been turned into a prison, designed to keep the scum of the city away from the people.

Battles occur as random encounters, Rogue Galaxy uses a real-time hack and slash combat system in which the player fights with a party of three characters. The player has direct control over only one character, although they can change which character that is at any time. The two NPCs fight independently of the player character, based on a strategy selected prior to the battle. Available strategies include fighting especially aggressively, targeting a specific enemy or not fighting at all. The strategy can also be changed at any time during the battle. Additionally, the player can issue specific orders to the NPCs during combat, such as having them use an item or activate one of their special abilities.","[1, 17, 18, 268435468, 268435487, 536870916, 536870979, 536870990, 536871138, 536871139, 536871186, 536871208, 536871213, 536871301, 536871390, 536871418, 536871758, 536871859, 536871882, 536871889, 536871938, 536871939, 536872098, 536872205, 536872425, 536872552, 536872553, 536872649, 536872959, 536873384, 536873473, 536873580, 536874810, 536875081, 536875196, 536875199, 536875304, 536875309, 536875331, 536875364, 536875380, 536875406, 536875436, 536875437, 536875453, 536875455, 536875477, 536875523, 536875525, 536875621, 536875695, 536875791, 536875830, 536875952, 536876235, 536876243, 536876266, 536876391, 536876489, 536876490, 536876507, 536876573, 536876593, 536876633, 536876704, 536876875, 536876876, 536876901, 536876913, 536876931, 536876976, 536876987, 536877035, 536877142, 536877216, 536877453, 536877806, 536877992, 536878138, 536878225, 536878255, 536878359, 536878470, 536879778, 536879789, 536879902, 536880241, 536880261, 536880316, 536880471, 536880575, 536881635, 536883058, 536883154, 536884018, 536887083, 536890023, 536890024, 536890025, 536890026]","[1, 17, 18]",0.0,78.02160889362806,15.0,https://www.igdb.com/games/rogue-galaxy

Previously, Dubai was a wealthy area with many high profile citizens until catastrophic sandstorms left a majority of the city buried. This caused many to evacuate, leaving only a few behind. One of the people left behind was U.S. Army Colonel John Konrad (a reference to the author of Heart of Darkness, Joseph Conrad), a founding member of Delta Force, who refused to evacuate from a training facility in the city and instead remained behind with the men under his command to help protect the citizens that could not evacuate. 
 
After several weeks of no contact, the Army fears that Col. Konrad and his men are lost to the destruction of the city until a weak distress signal is picked up. This gives the Army reason to deploy the player and their squad, who must infiltrate the city, neutralize outlaws and survive sandstorms as they attempt to determine what happened to Konrad and his men. Through the narrative in the trailer and sound clips from the game's website it is hinted that Konrad may not have entirely genuine motivations for remaining in Dubai against orders.","A third-person shooter in which three American soldiers led by Capt. Walker are sent to Dubai in order to recover whoever remains of an infantry unit, the 33rd Battalion, until they decide to take action against the militants situated in the city. As they progress, however, the logistical and ethical complexity of their objective deepens, and their perception of themselves, and their enemy, is put into question.","[1, 39, 268435461, 268435487, 536870913, 536870933, 536870970, 536871016, 536871041, 536871044, 536871133, 536871226, 536871315, 536871379, 536871475, 536871506, 536871549, 536871611, 536871626, 536871753, 536871809, 536871931, 536871937, 536872064, 536872070, 536872114, 536872140, 536872205, 536872225, 536872241, 536872245, 536872285, 536872315, 536872352, 536872419, 536872511, 536872638, 536872649, 536872673, 536872691, 536872695, 536872715, 536872733, 536872746, 536872799, 536872883, 536873021, 536873362, 536873425, 536873449, 536873753, 536873810, 536873878, 536873889, 536874115, 536874706, 536874743, 536874813, 536874906, 536874916, 536875046, 536875047, 536875062, 536875063, 536875081, 536875089, 536875090, 536875095, 536875101, 536875110, 536875112, 536875113, 536875114, 536875116, 536875157, 536875158, 536875171, 536875192, 536875199, 536875217, 536875228, 536875229, 536875232, 536875251, 536875257, 536875271, 536875275, 536875276, 536875287, 536875303, 536875305, 536875310, 536875326, 536875328, 536875330, 536875332, 536875340, 536875342, 536875358, 536875362, 536875364, 536875396, 536875420, 536875436, 536875437, 536875440, 536875460, 536875464, 536875470, 536875483, 536875485, 536875488, 536875490, 536875491, 536875492, 536875493, 536875495, 536875497, 536875501, 536875503, 536875504, 536875506, 536875507, 536875508, 536875511, 536875523, 536875532, 536875535, 536875536, 536875537, 536875538, 536875540, 536875542, 536875544, 536875545, 536875547, 536875549, 536875550, 536875572, 536875580, 536875583, 536875593, 536875625, 536875638, 536875649, 536875675, 536875689, 536875700, 536875741, 536875742, 536875743, 536875744, 536875745, 536875746, 536875747, 536875750, 536875751, 536875762, 536875781, 536875787, 536875792, 536875800, 536875803, 536875804, 536875808, 536875813, 536875818, 536875819, 536875822, 536875868, 536875880, 536875885, 536875910, 536875923, 536875941, 536876008, 536876028, 536876029, 536876031, 536876068, 536876073, 536876084, 536876097, 536876098, 536876108, 536876169, 536876171, 536876176, 536876178, 536876180, 536876189, 536876199, 536876221, 536876262, 536876275, 536876278, 536876287, 536876288, 536876302, 536876314, 536876321, 536876322, 536876325, 536876331, 536876332, 536876333, 536876340, 536876356, 536876361, 536876363, 536876364, 536876365, 536876380, 536876398, 536876413, 536876433, 536876434, 536876439, 536876441, 536876445, 536876446, 536876456, 536876459, 536876460, 536876461, 536876469, 536876474, 536876495, 536876498, 536876511, 536876516, 536876520, 536876521, 536876524, 536876534, 536876546, 536876574, 536876587, 536876603, 536876617, 536876623, 536876625, 536876626, 536876647, 536876648, 536876650, 536876654, 536876683, 536876685, 536876687, 536876695, 536876703, 536876755, 536876770, 536876798, 536876871, 536876875, 536876877, 536876880, 536876894, 536876899, 536876911, 536876922, 536876929, 536876938, 536876987, 536877026, 536877128, 536877149, 536877156, 536877157, 536877172, 536877173, 536877176, 536877177, 536877178, 536877181, 536877207, 536877275, 536877285, 536877286, 536877288, 536877306, 536877307, 536877309, 536877312, 536877314, 536877318, 536877319, 536877322, 536877323, 536877324, 536877331, 536877332, 536877333, 536877334, 536877337, 536877339, 536877341, 536877352, 536877389, 536877390, 536877393, 536877405, 536877497, 536877516, 536877518, 536877532, 536877536, 536877537, 536877540, 536877604, 536877606, 536877648, 536877656, 536877672, 536877740, 536877741, 536877742, 536877802, 536877809, 536877828, 536877950, 536877966, 536877974, 536878023, 536878027, 536878028, 536878063, 536878100, 536878127, 536878276, 536878280, 536878314, 536878317, 536878409, 536878415, 536878417, 536878427, 536878465, 536878490, 536878571, 536878582, 536878585, 536879038, 536879046, 536879054, 536879678, 536879731, 536879751, 536879764, 536879766, 536879830, 536879832, 536879881, 536879984, 536880058, 536880210, 536880223, 536880348, 536880355, 536880402, 536880508, 536880685, 536880725, 536880781, 536880791, 536880948, 536881279, 536881408, 536881540, 536882001, 536882002, 536882011, 536882333, 536883374, 536883868, 536883869, 536889479, 536892003, 536892004]","[1, 39]",1377.0,79.70459756503925,395.0,https://www.igdb.com/games/spec-ops-the-line

Now, as a string of murders casts a shroud over the city and the law begins to fail, justice cannot afford to be blind. 
 
The son of a murdered lawyer, Takayuki Yagami was raised on the streets of Kamurocho by a yakuza patriarch who paves the way for Yagami to follow in his real father's footsteps. Taking a job at the Genda Law Office, Yagami accepts a high-profile case: Proving Shinpei Okubo, a man suspected of murder, innocent. 
 
Against all odds, Yagami succeeds and is hailed as a hero, but his prolific career is short-lived. Only months later, Okubo brutally murders his girlfriend, stabbing her over ten times with a kitchen knife before setting their apartment on fire. 
 
Yagami becomes the lawyer who let a murderer walk - and everything he had worked for comes crashing down. 
 
Three years later, Yagami has taken off his lawyer's badge to run a small detective agency in the red-light district of Kamurocho, scraping by on odd jobs and evidence collection. 
 
But even a city as seedy as this is shaken by a string of serial murders, where the victims' bodies are discovered with their eyes gouged out. Yagami is drawn into the case by his old law firm, where he discovers that in order to bring this killer to light, he must seek the truth that slipped from his grasp three years ago. But can a man haunted by his failures prevail over his own past?","Judgment is an action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective. The game is a legal thriller set in the Yakuza world of Kamurocho and follows private detective Takayuki Yagami as he investigates a serial murder case.

Throughout it, he faces the consequences of the horrors he committed in his past lives and tries to find the root of all the torment plaguing his companions and the Planes.","[17, 31, 268435467, 268435468, 268435471, 536870928, 536871041, 536871044, 536871059, 536871117, 536871138, 536871208, 536871213, 536871409, 536871470, 536871489, 536871506, 536871599, 536871672, 536871728, 536871784, 536871818, 536871878, 536871889, 536871931, 536871938, 536872010, 536872019, 536872098, 536872184, 536872225, 536872232, 536872257, 536872334, 536872371, 536872419, 536872425, 536872435, 536872647, 536872669, 536872793, 536872873, 536872898, 536872957, 536873326, 536873352, 536873364, 536873384, 536873822, 536873863, 536873947, 536873973, 536874115, 536874343, 536874398, 536874745, 536875042, 536875044, 536875050, 536875054, 536875074, 536875081, 536875083, 536875089, 536875095, 536875101, 536875116, 536875124, 536875131, 536875151, 536875161, 536875169, 536875196, 536875197, 536875199, 536875229, 536875232, 536875239, 536875258, 536875275, 536875286, 536875300, 536875306, 536875307, 536875311, 536875314, 536875318, 536875319, 536875324, 536875330, 536875331, 536875334, 536875340, 536875342, 536875344, 536875356, 536875361, 536875372, 536875380, 536875420, 536875426, 536875436, 536875452, 536875453, 536875455, 536875460, 536875485, 536875493, 536875502, 536875503, 536875511, 536875523, 536875524, 536875531, 536875534, 536875537, 536875544, 536875546, 536875547, 536875549, 536875551, 536875554, 536875575, 536875639, 536875649, 536875665, 536875675, 536875677, 536875699, 536875705, 536875738, 536875741, 536875745, 536875752, 536875762, 536875768, 536875778, 536875779, 536875792, 536875800, 536875803, 536875809, 536875822, 536875855, 536875896, 536875914, 536875930, 536875934, 536875941, 536875951, 536875952, 536875953, 536876006, 536876010, 536876024, 536876029, 536876031, 536876034, 536876084, 536876093, 536876098, 536876109, 536876128, 536876170, 536876185, 536876267, 536876270, 536876277, 536876287, 536876301, 536876306, 536876333, 536876340, 536876358, 536876373, 536876377, 536876414, 536876429, 536876456, 536876461, 536876474, 536876481, 536876483, 536876495, 536876498, 536876505, 536876511, 536876559, 536876562, 536876571, 536876573, 536876586, 536876588, 536876596, 536876597, 536876605, 536876609, 536876613, 536876620, 536876621, 536876625, 536876626, 536876650, 536876653, 536876654, 536876662, 536876663, 536876706, 536876730, 536876731, 536876752, 536876770, 536876850, 536876851, 536876879, 536876919, 536876926, 536876943, 536876955, 536876960, 536876969, 536876974, 536876982, 536876996, 536877000, 536877014, 536877028, 536877237, 536877242, 536877306, 536877310, 536877332, 536877373, 536877583, 536877594, 536877596, 536877614, 536877616, 536877643, 536877645, 536877653, 536877724, 536877749, 536877755, 536877907, 536877908, 536877917, 536877931, 536877960, 536877965, 536877971, 536877974, 536878005, 536878210, 536878226, 536878227, 536878308, 536878328, 536878335, 536878358, 536878373, 536878494, 536878495, 536878496, 536878513, 536878517, 536878523, 536878528, 536878601, 536878602, 536878611, 536879059, 536879062, 536879136, 536879704, 536879891, 536879895, 536879896, 536879901, 536880240, 536880241, 536880285, 536880479, 536880540, 536880567, 536880568, 536880573, 536880579, 536880907, 536880918, 536880925, 536880959, 536881062, 536881122, 536881260, 536881530, 536881597, 536881650, 536881661, 536881716, 536882138, 536882399, 536882692, 536882869, 536883035, 536883426, 536883849, 536884031]","[17, 31]",832.0,81.5798236518824,147.0,https://www.igdb.com/games/planescape-torment

The game features an open-world environment and action-based battle system similar to the Kingdom Hearts series and Type-0, incorporating the ability to switch weapons and other elements such as vehicle travel and camping.","[1, 17, 18, 21, 33, 268435460, 268435468, 268435487, 536870916, 536870934, 536870979, 536870981, 536870988, 536871033, 536871044, 536871059, 536871076, 536871079, 536871127, 536871139, 536871157, 536871165, 536871208, 536871229, 536871244, 536871251, 536871301, 536871409, 536871474, 536871475, 536871487, 536871506, 536871581, 536871701, 536871758, 536871882, 536871938, 536871945, 536872010, 536872100, 536872152, 536872205, 536872352, 536872371, 536872425, 536872550, 536872587, 536872695, 536872883, 536872898, 536872957, 536872983, 536873154, 536873318, 536873350, 536873364, 536873384, 536873422, 536873455, 536873507, 536873718, 536875046, 536875066, 536875073, 536875081, 536875133, 536875136, 536875146, 536875156, 536875157, 536875265, 536875269, 536875271, 536875281, 536875358, 536875380, 536875401, 536875402, 536875426, 536875437, 536875490, 536875494, 536875523, 536875527, 536875572, 536875596, 536875610, 536875654, 536875668, 536875695, 536875738, 536875755, 536875764, 536875783, 536875794, 536875795, 536875802, 536875830, 536875837, 536875931, 536875934, 536876007, 536876023, 536876072, 536876103, 536876168, 536876211, 536876219, 536876227, 536876235, 536876241, 536876291, 536876363, 536876365, 536876381, 536876406, 536876454, 536876478, 536876505, 536876520, 536876550, 536876574, 536876701, 536876735, 536876799, 536876814, 536876816, 536876848, 536876912, 536876922, 536876985, 536876993, 536876996, 536877006, 536877047, 536877077, 536877109, 536877133, 536877147, 536877151, 536877153, 536877203, 536877210, 536877303, 536877324, 536877520, 536877548, 536877568, 536877660, 536877984, 536877985, 536877986, 536878072, 536878127, 536878270, 536878363, 536878417, 536878440, 536878577, 536878600, 536879050, 536879070, 536879108, 536879215, 536879227, 536879689, 536879746, 536879940, 536879974, 536879992, 536880134, 536880158, 536880240, 536880359, 536880420, 536880467, 536881120, 536882663, 536882999, 536883004, 536883468, 536883637, 536884075, 536885494, 536885495, 536887738, 536887740, 536887806, 536889303, 536889304]","[1, 17, 18, 21, 33]",359.0,79.892582291917,262.0,https://www.igdb.com/games/final-fantasy-xv

However, the train is a trap set by Handsome Jack, and it explodes. The Vault Hunters regain consciousness in a frozen wasteland and are found by the last remaining Hyperion CL4P-TP (""Claptrap"") unit. The Guardian Angel contacts the Vault Hunters and instructs them to accompany Claptrap to the city of Sanctuary, and to join the Crimson Raiders, an anti-Hyperion resistance movement, in order to defeat Handsome Jack. Claptrap and the Vault Hunters are able to escape the frozen wastes after defeating Captain Flynt, the local bandit leader, and retaking Claptrap's boat. Along the way, Handsome Jack taunts the Vault Hunters, while the Guardian Angel offers advice and comfort. 
Upon arriving at the gates of Sanctuary, the Vault Hunters are asked to rescue Roland, now leader of the Crimson Raiders, who has been captured by a bounty hunter called the Firehawk. The Vault Hunters meet the Firehawk, who turns out to be Lilith(an existing and playable character in Borderlands), whose powers as a siren have been significantly enhanced by the new supply of eridium. Lilith informs the Vault Hunters that Roland was actually captured by a group of bandits. After fighting through the bandits' territory, the Vault Hunters rescue Roland and return to Sanctuary. 
Roland and Lilith learn that the Vault Key is being transported aboard a Hyperion train, and task the Vault Hunters to retrieve it. To accomplish the mission, the Vault Hunters enlist the aid of former Vault Hunter Mordecai, and of Tiny Tina, a psychotic explosives-obsessed thirteen-year-old. The Vault Hunters derail the train, but instead of finding the Vault Key, they encounter Wilhelm, a powerful Hyperion cyborg. After Wilhelm's defeat, the Vault Hunters recover his power core, which Roland recommends be used as the power source for Sanctuary's shields. The power core turns out to be a trap; it allows the Guardian Angel, who is actually working for Jack, to lower the city's shields and render it vulnerable to a bombardment from the Hyperion moon satellite. Lilith saves Sanctuary, which was originally a large spacecraft, by activating its engines and teleporting it away; for the rest of the game, Sanctuary exists as a flying city in the sky. 
Jack's true plan is revealed: to open Pandora's second Vault and unleash The Warrior, a powerful lava, eridium, and rock creature controlled by whomever releases it. Additionally, he is forcing Angel to help him charge the Vault Key more quickly than usual. Angel communicates with the group in Sanctuary, and despite hostile treatment from Roland, divulges that the Vault Key is kept with her in a Hyperion facility. She also shares information about the formidable defenses of the facility. The Vault Hunters embark upon a series of missions in order to assemble what is needed to overcome these defenses, including obtaining an upgrade for Claptrap, visiting the Hyperion city of Opportunity, and enlisting the aid of Brick, now leader of the Slab clan of bandits. During the process, Mordecai's pet bird Bloodwing is captured and killed by Handsome Jack; a grief-stricken Mordecai vows revenge and joins the other three former Vault Hunters at Sanctuary. Roland and the Vault Hunters assault the Hyperion compound and meet Angel, who is not only a real person, but a siren, and Handsome Jack's daughter. She requests to be killed in order to stop her father from charging the Vault Key and gaining control of The Warrior. Handsome Jack sends in waves of security forces in order to protect his daughter, but ultimately, Roland and the Vault Hunters, with the help of late arrival Lilith, successfully kill Angel. An enraged Handsome Jack teleports in, kills Roland, and captures Lilith, whom he forces to resume charging the Vault Key in Angel's stead. Lilith manages to teleport the Vault Hunter out of the facility and back to Sanctuary. 
Mordecai and Brick decide to learn the location of the second Vault and confront Handsome Jack and The Warrior. While the Vault Hunters travel to the Hyperion Information Annex and obtains the Vault's location, the two steal a Hyperion ship. The Vault Hunters approach on foot, battling elite Hyperion security forces, while Brick and Mordecai are shot down but left alive. Ultimately, the Vault Hunters confront, battle, and defeat Handsome Jack himself, but arrive too late to prevent him from opening the Vault. Handsome Jack summons The Warrior, a gargantuan dragon-like lava creature, and orders it to kill the Vault Hunters. After a long battle, the Vault Hunters defeat the Warrior, and executes Handsome Jack in the aftermath. 
Brick and Mordecai arrive just as Lilith attempts to destroy the Vault Key. However, she accidentally activates a secret information bank containing a huge map of the galaxy with several Vaults marked on it. Lilith remarks that ""there ain't no rest for the wicked"" before the screen fades to black.","Five years after the events of Borderlands, a valuable mineral called ""Eridium"" starts flourishing through Pandora's crust.

She informs Geralt that Emperor Emhyr has summoned him to the city of Vizima. There, Emhyr tasks Geralt with finding Ciri, who has been recently spotted in various locations. Ciri is a Child of the Elder Blood, the last heir to an ancient Elven bloodline that bestows her with the power to manipulate space and time. 
 
Geralt first follows clues that Ciri was in Velen at Crow's Perch, the fort of the Bloody Baron. The Baron refuses to help, but Geralt's acquaintance, sorceress Keira Metz, informs him that an Elven mage, Avallac'h, was searching for Ciri. Keira directs Geralt to the Crones of Crookback Bog, malicious, ancient spirits residing near Velen. The Crones reveal that they had captured Ciri for the Wild Hunt before she escaped, and that they have enslaved the Baron's missing wife, Anna. After determining Anna's fate, Geralt returns to the Baron who tells him that Ciri went to Novigrad. 
 
Arriving in Novigrad, Geralt discovers that the Church of the Eternal Fire, a militant religious organization, is purging mages in the city. Rendezvousing with his former lover, Triss Merigold, Geralt learns that Ciri had contacted his friend Dandelion. Geralt navigates Novigrad's criminal underworld to rescue Dandelion, and discovers that Ciri teleported to the Skellige archipelago. While in Novigrad, Geralt may assist Triss in liberating fugitive mages. 
 
After sailing to Skellige, Geralt reunites with Yennefer, who has been investigating a magical explosion linked to Ciri. The pair track Ciri's movements to the island of Lofoten and learn the Wild Hunt have attacked it. Following clues, they realise that Uma, a deformed, cursed creature at Crow's Perch, was present following Ciri's escape. Before leaving Skellige, Geralt can help determine who will become the leader of Skellige following the king's death. Yennefer chooses to sever the magical bond that draws her and Geralt together, giving him the option to willingly affirm his love for her or end their relationship. 
 
The pair recover Uma to the abandoned witcher school of Kaer Morhen where Yennefer successfully removes Uma's curse, transforming him into Avallac'h. He reveals that he teleported Ciri to the Isle of Mists to save her from the Lofoten attack. Geralt travels to the Isle and finds Ciri in a deathlike state until she is awakened by Avallac'h's magic. Ciri reveals that the King of the Wild Hunt, Eredin's homeworld is being destroyed by a plight known as the White Frost, and he wants Ciri's power in order to conquer the Continent. Ciri and Geralt teleport to Kaer Morhen pursued by the Wild Hunt. After a brief reunion with Yennefer, Triss, and their witcher mentor Vesemir, the Hunt attacks. Vesemir is killed protecting Ciri and her distress causes her to uncontrollably unleash her Elder power leading Eredin and the Hunt to retreat. Geralt, Yennefer, Triss, Ciri, and their allies then hold a funeral for Vesemir. 
 
Ciri and Geralt travel to Novigrad and help Triss and Yennefer reform the Lodge of Sorceresses to aid in their fight. They also learn about the Sunstone, a relic that can lure Eredin out and bind him to a location. On the Skelligan isle of Undvik, Avallac'h uses the Sunstone to draw out the Hunt and their fleet. Geralt, Ciri, their allies and the Nilfgaardian fleet battle the Hunt, before Geralt faces Eredin in combat and emerges victorious. As the White Frost descends on Skellige, Ciri insists that she must confront it with her Elder Blood before it consumes all life on every world. Ciri enters a portal and defeats the White Frost, ending the threat. 
 
The ending varies depending on choices made throughout the game. If Ciri is alive, Geralt can retire with either Yennefer or Triss, or remain a lone Witcher. If Geralt helps Nilfgaard win the war and took Ciri to meet the emperor, she will become Empress, believing it the best way to positively affect the world; if Ciri doesn't meet the Emperor, Geralt fakes her death and she becomes a Witcher. If Ciri dies fighting the White Frost, Geralt hunts down her stolen medallion as a keepsake, but is surrounded by monsters upon its discovery, leaving his fate ambiguous.

With a can-do attitude, plenty of grit, and her trusty vacpack, Beatrix attempts to stake a claim, amass a fortune, and avoid the continual peril that looms from the rolling, jiggling avalanche of slimes around every corner. 


Slime Rancher is a first-person, sandbox experience where players will solve problems and survive through mastery of their vacpack: a vacuum/cannon/backpack that can vacuum up and blast out anything that isn’t nailed to the ground. 

Each day will present new challenges to players as they attempt to amass a great fortune in the business of slime ranching. While players are free to approach these challenges however they wish, a typical day might look like this: 

*You wake at the crack of dawn and get to watering the crops at the ranch. Some slimes are vegetarian, after all. Then it’s time to gather up the plumpest hens from the chicken coop. Some slimes are totally not vegetarian, after all. 

*Next, you’re off to feed slimes their breakfast over at the slime corrals so they don’t get too out of hand during the day. Hungry slimes get jumpy. Jumpy slimes can’t be contained. 

*With your ranch set for the day, it’s time to begin exploring the untamed wilds of the Far, Far Range. Along the way, you’ll encounter slimes you’ve never seen before, discover a new type of veggie to cultivate back at the ranch, and narrowly avoid certain doom in a valley of burly, feral slimes. 

*With the sun setting, it’s time to head back to the ranch, rustle up some dinner for your slimes, and try and figure out just how the heck you’ll keep these new slimes that seem to, well, explode all the time. 

*But you can do this. You had the courage to travel a thousand light years away from home to make a living as a slime rancher. Slimes that go boom? No problem. Slimes that burn with a radioactive aura? Bring it on. Slimes that wiggle their butts?

After arriving at the station and eluding Combine forces, Gordon joins Lambda resistance members including Barney Calhoun, a former Black Mesa security guard now working undercover as a Combine CP officer, and Alyx Vance, the daughter of one of Gordon's former colleagues, Dr. Eli Vance. After a failed attempt to teleport Gordon to Black Mesa East from Dr. Kleiner's makeshift laboratory, Gordon, re-equipped with the HEV suit and a crowbar, is forced to embark on foot through the city's old canal system. After obtaining an airboat, he battles his way to Black Mesa East, several miles from the city. 
Gordon is reintroduced to Eli and meets Dr. Judith Mossman. Alyx introduces Gordon to her large pet robot D0g and gives him a ""Gravity Gun"", a weapon which allows Gordon to pick up and move any large object with ease. Black Mesa East soon comes under Combine attack and Eli and Mossman are captured to be taken to a Combine prison, Nova Prospekt. Gordon and Alyx are forced to take separate paths to Nova Prospekt; Gordon takes a detour through the town of Ravenholm, receiving help from its last survivor, Father Grigori. After making his way through the town and a mine, Gordon makes his way to a Resistance outpost. Gordon is provided with a Dune Buggy, which he uses to travel along a crumbling coastal road to Nova Prospekt. Along the way, Gordon encounters frequent Combine patrols, and helps one of the resistance leaders, Colonel Odessa Cubbage, to defend a Resistance base from a Combine gunship. 
After crossing an antlion-infested beach, Gordon enters Nova Prospekt, where he is reunited with Alyx. They manage to locate Eli, but also discover that Mossman is a Combine informant. Before they can stop her, she teleports herself and Eli back to City 17's Citadel. The Combine teleporter explodes as Gordon and Alyx use it to escape Nova Prospekt. 
Upon reaching Kleiner's lab, a shaken Dr. Kleiner reveals to Gordon and Alyx that they were caught in a ""slow teleport"", during which a week had passed. In their absence, the Resistance, who heard about what had happened at Nova Prospekt, has mobilized against the Combine, turning City 17 into a battleground. During the fighting, Alyx is captured by the Combine and taken to the Citadel, and Gordon fights through the city with the aid of D0g and Barney to reach it. Inside the Citadel, he is caught in a Combine confiscation chamber that destroys all of his weapons except for the Gravity Gun, the energy enhancing its capabilities and allowing Gordon to escape and dispatch platoons of Combine soldiers. 
Eventually, Gordon is captured riding in a Combine transport pod and is taken to Dr. Breen's office, where he and Dr. Mossman are waiting with Eli and Alyx in captivity. Dr. Breen begins to explain his plans for further conquest of the humans by the Combine, contrary to what he had told Dr. Mossman. Angered, Mossman frees Gordon, Alyx, and Eli before Breen teleports them off-world. Dr. Breen tries to escape through a portal, but Gordon pursues him and destroys the portal reactor with the super-charged Gravity Gun. Breen appears to be annihilated in the resulting explosion. Just before Gordon and Alyx are presumably met with a similar fate, time is frozen. The G-Man reappears, praising Gordon for his actions in City 17 and the Citadel. Making vague mention of ""offers for [Gordon's] services"", the G-Man places him back into stasis.","Half-Life 2 (stylized as HλLF-LIFE²), the sequel to Half-Life, is a first-person shooter video game and part of the Half-Life series.
